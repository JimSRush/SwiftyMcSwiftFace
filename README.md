# SwiftyMcSwiftFace
A bunch of algorithmic challenges in Swift, complete with tests.

This uses code from the blog '[TDD in Swift Playgrounds](http://initwithstyle.net/2015/11/tdd-in-swift-playgrounds/)' as the basis to get the tests running (lots of boilerplate)

Some of the algorithmic challenges are modified from [codingbat](http://codingbat.com/), if you're a Python or Java programmer, there's a wealth of stuff on there.
